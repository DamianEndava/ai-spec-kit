        "question": "What does “standardized SpecKit” mean in this context—do you have an existing template or JSON schema to conform to?",
        "whyItMatters": "A definitive structure is required to implement the generation logic and to validate the JSON output."
      },
      {
        "area": "businessGoals",
        "question": "Who are the primary users (e.g., BAs, PMs, founders) and what problem metrics define success (e.g., time to first draft, completeness score)?",

      },
      {
        "area": "functionalRequirements",
        "question": "How is the interview transcript formed—should the engine use the live chat history as input, or will users upload/provide a separate transcript?",
        "whyItMatters": "Determines integration points between the chat UI and the generation engine."
      },
      {
        "area": "functionalRequirements",
        "question": "Should users be able to review and edit the generated SpecKit in the UI before finalizing?",

      },
      {
        "area": "functionalRequirements",
        "question": "Do you need export/download options (e.g., .md and .json files) or is in-app display/return via API sufficient?",

        "area": "functionalRequirements",
        "question": "Is streaming of model responses required in the chat UI?",

        "area": "functionalRequirements",

        "area": "technology",
        "question": "Which OpenAI model(s) should be used and with what parameters (e.g., temperature, max tokens)?",

        "area": "technology",
