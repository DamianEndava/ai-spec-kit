## Requirements examples

# example 1

The company operates a chain of urban grocery stores and wants to reduce food waste while improving product availability.
Currently, stock decisions are made manually and often lead to overstocking or empty shelves.

The goal of the system is to predict product demand and automatically recommend optimal replenishment quantities.
The system should reduce food waste by at least 15% within the first year.
It should also improve on-shelf availability for high-demand items during peak hours.

The backend will be implemented using Java with Spring Boot.
Data will be stored in PostgreSQL and processed using Python-based machine learning services.
The frontend will be a React web application hosted on a cloud platform (AWS).

# example 2
